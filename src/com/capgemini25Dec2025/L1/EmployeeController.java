    //INNER JOIN AND OUTER JOIN

    //TRANSIENT AND VOLATILE

    //DELETE VS TRUNCATE

    //SINGLETON DESIGN PATTERN

    //write all the opration like get one employee, get all employee, delete all, delete one

    // difference between vector and arraylist

    // hashmap, linkedhahsmap and treemap

    // string, string buffer and string builder

    /* vector vs arraylist
    *swap two varaible without using third varaible
    * use java 8 to find the duplicates in a given list
    * string vs string buffer vs string builder
    * break vs continue
    * auto boxing vs unboxing
    * how does spring boot app works
    * spring initializer
    * what is microservices
    * what is api gateway
    * explain service discovery
    * circuit breaker design pattern in java
    *
    * q1: if calling third party in a microservices doing authorization and verify the users if in one page using three
    * and four api calling all three to four we are calling third party services but at the same time we are checking
    * the authentication og that getting token or not and sometimes we are facing issues of forbidden why is it so?
    *
    *
    * q2: write some code for id, name and salary, update salary for all employees for endpoints api, endpoints for get all employees,
    * one employee using one method and update and delete employee create all three rest end points
    *
    * create one method only to call one or multiple employee
    *
    * explain inner join vs outer join
    *
    *
    * what is spring initializer explain in detail
